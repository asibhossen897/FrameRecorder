<p>Imagine you are drawing pictures or writing a program on your computer. You struggle for hours without getting up. Maybe you can't finish it in one day and continue the next day. After a long time, you complete your work. Wouldn't you like to shoot small clips of your work while doing this? That's when Frame Recorder comes to your aid. Just enter FPS (frame per second) and it will save it for you!</p>
